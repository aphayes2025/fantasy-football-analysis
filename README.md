# fantasy-football-analysis

I wanted to create a project to showcase my passion for data science and football. I have been a football fan since I was a kid and loved to collect football cards to look at the players statistics. To this day I love looking through PFF grades and analyzing football statistics. I hope this projects gives you some insight on some interesting topics in football. If you have any comments or critque about my coding, use of statstics, or analysis of football let me know!
